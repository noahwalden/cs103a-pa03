# Course Search App

This is a web application written in Express that allows you to search a
MongoDB database for courses that you might want to take.

## To install and run

Once you have MongoDB, node, and npm installed locally,
start up the MongoDB service.

Clone the repository
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/noahwalden/cs103a-pa03.git
```

`cd` into the repository and run

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

You can also install `nodemon` and run the application with it
so that it will reload in real time with your changes. Before experimenting
with the schedule builder, be sure to visit the `/upsertDB` route to
load all the course information into the database.
